# EIP-4337

## Simple Summary

`UserOperation` - pseudo-transaction type for user-initiated operations.

These operations are sent to a different transaction mempool and are processed by a new kind of actor, called `Bundler`. These `UserOperations` are packaged up into a transaction making a `handleOps` call to a special contract; that transaction gets included into a block.

## Motivation

Decentralization:

-   Achieves key goal of removing the need for EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts).
-   Allows any `Bundler` to include `UserOperations` into a block.
-   Works with all activity happening over a public mempool; users don't need to know about the `Bundler`'s private mempool.
-   Avoids trust assumptions

No consensus changes are needed.

Other use cases:

-   Privacy preserving applications
-   Atomic multi operations (like EIP-3074)
-   Pay tx fees with ERC-20
-   Support aggregated signature (like BLS)

## Specification

### UserOperation

`UserOperation` is a new pseudo-transaction type.

It contains the following fields:

| Parameter              | Type      | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sender`               | `address` | The account contract sending a user operation                                                        |
| `nonce`                | `uint256` | Anti-replay protection; also used as the salt for first-time account creation                        |
| `to`                   | `address` |                                                                                                      |
| `initCode`             | `bytes`   | initCode of the account (only needed if the account is not yet on-chain and and needs to be created) |
| `calldata`             | `bytes`   | The data to pass to `sender` during main execution call                                              |
| `callGasLimit`         | `uint256` | The data to pass to `sender` during main execution call                                              |
| `verificationGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step                                              |
| `preVerificationGas`   | `uint256` | The amount of gas to pay for to compensate the bundler for pre-verification execution and calldata   |
| `maxFeePerGas`         | `uint256` | Maximum fee per gas (like EIP-1559)                                                                  |
| `maxPriorityFeePerGas` | `uint256` | Maximum priority fee per gas (like EIP-1559)                                                         |
| `paymasterAndData`     | `bytes`   | Paymaster address sponsoring the transaction with extra data (empty for self-sponsored transactions) |
| `signature`            | `bytes`   | Data passed into the account along with the nonce during the verification step                       |

### Definitions

-   `Nonce` - anti-replay protection; also used as the salt for first-time account creation
-   `EntryPoint` - a singleton contract to execute bundles of `UserOperations`. `Bundlers` or `Clients` whitelist the supported entrypoint.
-   `Bundler` - a node that bundles multiple `UserOperations` and creates an `EntryPoint.handleOps()` transaction.
-   `Aggregator` - a helper contract trusted by accounts to validate an aggregated signature. `Bundlers` or `Clients` whitelist the supported aggregator.

A bundle transaction packages up multiple `UserOperations` into a single `handleOps` call to a pre-published global entry point contract.

## Entry Point Contract

The Entry Point Contract core interface looks like this:

```solidity
interface IEntryPoint {

    struct UserOperation {
        address sender;
        uint256 nonce;
        uint256 callGasLimit;
        uint256 verificationGasLimit;
        uint256 preVerificationGas;
        uint256 maxFeePerGas;
        uint256 maxPriorityFeePerGas;
        bytes initCode;
        bytes callData;
        bytes paymasterAndData;
        bytes signature;
    }

    function handleOps(
        UserOperation[] calldata ops,
        address payable beneficiary
    ) external;

    ====================

    struct UserOpsPerAggregator {
        UserOperation[] userOps;
        IAggregator aggregator;
        // aggregated signature
        bytes signature;
    }

    function handleAggregatedOps(
        UserOpsPerAggregator[] calldata opsPerAggregator,
        address payable beneficiary
    ) external;

    ====================

    error ValidationResult(
        ReturnInfo returnInfo,
        StakeInfo senderInfo,
        StakeInfo factoryInfo,
        StakeInfo paymasterInfo
    );

    error ValidationResultWithAggregation(
        ReturnInfo returnInfo,
        StakeInfo senderInfo,
        StakeInfo factoryInfo,
        StakeInfo paymasterInfo,
        AggregatorStakeInfo aggregatorInfo
    );

    function simulateValidation(
        UserOperation calldata userOp
    ) external;

    struct ReturnInfo {
        uint256 preOpGas;
        uint256 prefund;
        bool sigFailed;
        uint48 validAfter;
        uint48 validUntil;
        bytes paymasterContext;
    }

    struct StakeInfo {
        uint256 stake;
        uint256 unstakeDelaySec;
    }

    struct AggregatorStakeInfo {
        address actualAggregator;
        StakeInfo stakeInfo;
    }
}
```
